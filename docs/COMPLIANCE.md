# Compliance Documentation

This document outlines compliance considerations and frameworks applicable to LLM Cost Tracker deployments.

## Overview

LLM Cost Tracker processes potentially sensitive data including API usage patterns, cost information, and system metrics. Organizations deploying this system should consider relevant compliance frameworks based on their industry and geographic location.

## Data Classification

### Data Types Processed

|-----------|------------------|-----------|---------|
| API Usage Metrics | Low-Medium | Configurable | Cost tracking, optimization |
| Cost Data | Medium | Business requirement | Budget management, reporting |
| Model Requests | Medium-High | Minimal | Performance monitoring |
| System Logs | Low-Medium | 90 days default | Troubleshooting, security |
| Alert Configurations | Medium | Indefinite | Operations |

### Data Flow

```
LLM Applications → Cost Tracker → PostgreSQL → Grafana/Prometheus

   - Strong access controls
   - Regular security testing
   - Information security policy

2. **SOX Compliance** (US public companies)
   - Financial reporting controls
   - IT general controls
   - Change management
   - Access controls

## Implementation Guidelines

### Data Retention Policies

```yaml
# Example retention configuration
retention_policies:
  traces:
    default: "90d"
    detailed_logs: "30d"
    aggregated_metrics: "2y"
  
  cost_data:
    raw_data: "7y"  # Financial records requirement
    reports: "10y"
    
  system_logs:
    application: "1y"
    security: "2y"
    audit: "7y"
```

### Access Controls

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
   ```yaml
   roles:
     - name: "cost_viewer"
       permissions: ["read:metrics", "read:dashboards"]
     - name: "cost_admin"
       permissions: ["read:*", "write:configuration", "manage:alerts"]
     - name: "system_admin"
       permissions: ["admin:*"]
   ```

2. **API Key Management**
   - Regular rotation schedules
   - Principle of least privilege
   - Audit logging for key usage

### Audit Trail Requirements

1. **System Events to Log**
   - User authentication attempts
   - Configuration changes
   - Data access patterns
   - Administrative actions
   - Security events

2. **Log Format Standards**
   ```json
   {
     "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
     "event_type": "data_access",
     "user_id": "user123",
     "resource": "/api/v1/costs",
     "action": "read",
     "result": "success",
     "ip_address": "192.168.1.100",
     "user_agent": "dashboard/1.0"
   }
   ```

### Encryption Standards

   ```bash
   # Example security validation
   docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace \
     securityscan/compliance-checker:latest \
     --framework soc2 --path /workspace
   ```

2. **Configuration Validation**
   ```python
   # Example policy validation
   def validate_encryption_compliance():
       assert database_encryption_enabled()
       assert tls_version_minimum("1.3")
       assert key_rotation_enabled()
   ```

### Compliance Reporting

   - Monthly risk assessments
   - Quarterly audit preparations
   - Annual compliance reviews

2. **Metrics and KPIs**
   - Security incident response time
   - Data breach incidents (target: 0)
   - Compliance control effectiveness
   - Audit finding resolution time
