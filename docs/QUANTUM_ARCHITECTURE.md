# 🌌 Quantum-Inspired Task Planning Architecture

## Overview

The Quantum Task Planner represents a revolutionary approach to computational task scheduling, drawing inspiration from quantum mechanics principles to optimize complex task dependencies and resource allocation.

## 🧬 Quantum-Inspired Concepts

### Superposition
Tasks exist in multiple potential states simultaneously until "observed" (scheduled for execution). This allows the system to explore multiple scheduling possibilities in parallel.

```python
class TaskState(Enum):
    SUPERPOSITION = "superposition"  # Task exists in multiple potential states
    COLLAPSED = "collapsed"          # Task state has been measured/determined
    ENTANGLED = "entangled"         # Task is dependent on other tasks
    EXECUTING = "executing"         # Task is currently running
    COMPLETED = "completed"         # Task finished successfully
    FAILED = "failed"               # Task execution failed
```

### Entanglement
Tasks can be quantum entangled, meaning their states are correlated. When one entangled task changes state, it affects the probability distribution of its entangled partners.

```python
def entangle_with(self, other_task_id: str) -> None:
    """Create entanglement with another task."""
    self.entangled_tasks.add(other_task_id)
    self.state = TaskState.ENTANGLED
```

### Interference Patterns
Tasks exhibit interference effects where their execution probabilities are modified by proximity to other tasks in the scheduling space.

```python
def get_execution_probability(self) -> float:
    """Calculate the probability of successful execution."""
    base_prob = abs(self.probability_amplitude) ** 2
    
    # Apply interference effects
    interference_factor = 1.0
    for task_id, effect in self.interference_pattern.items():
        interference_factor *= (1.0 + effect)
    
    return max(0.0, min(1.0, base_prob * interference_factor))
```

### Quantum Annealing
The scheduler uses quantum annealing algorithms to find optimal task execution orders by gradually "cooling" the system and allowing it to settle into low-energy (optimal) configurations.

```python
def quantum_anneal_schedule(self, max_iterations: int = 1000) -> List[str]:
    """Use quantum annealing to find optimal task execution order."""
    temperature = self.temperature
    
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        # Generate neighbor schedule by swapping two tasks
        new_schedule = current_schedule.copy()
        i, j = random.sample(range(len(new_schedule)), 2)
        new_schedule[i], new_schedule[j] = new_schedule[j], new_schedule[i]
        
        new_cost = self._calculate_schedule_cost(new_schedule)
        cost_delta = new_cost - current_cost
        
        # Accept or reject based on quantum annealing criteria
        if cost_delta < 0 or random.random() < math.exp(-cost_delta / temperature):
            current_schedule = new_schedule
            current_cost = new_cost
        
        # Cool down
        temperature *= self.cooling_rate
```

### Mathematical Models

The system uses several mathematical models inspired by quantum mechanics:

#### Wave Function Representation
```python
# Task probability amplitude (complex number)
probability_amplitude: complex = complex(1.0, 0.0)

# Execution probability from amplitude
execution_probability = abs(probability_amplitude) ** 2
```

#### Schrödinger-Inspired Evolution
```python
# Task state evolution over time
def evolve_state(self, time_delta: float) -> None:
    """Evolve task state using quantum-inspired dynamics."""
    phase_factor = cmath.exp(1j * self.energy_level * time_delta / self.h_bar)
    self.probability_amplitude *= phase_factor
```

#### Quantum Annealing Energy Function
```python
def _calculate_schedule_cost(self, schedule: List[str]) -> float:
    """Calculate the 'energy' of a given task schedule."""
    cost = 0.0
    
    # Dependency violation penalty (high energy)
    for task_id in schedule:
        task = self.tasks[task_id]
        for dep_id in task.dependencies:
            if dep_id in schedule and schedule.index(dep_id) > schedule.index(task_id):
                cost += 1000.0  # Heavy penalty
    
    # Resource contention cost
    # Priority-based timing cost
    # Interference effects
    
    return cost
```
