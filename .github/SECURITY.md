# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We actively support the following versions of LLM Cost Tracker with security updates:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## Security Model

### Data Protection
- All API keys and secrets are encrypted at rest
- Database connections use TLS encryption
- All inter-service communication is secured
- Sensitive data is never logged in plain text

### Access Controls
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for multi-tenant deployments
- API key authentication with SHA-256 hashing
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Input validation and sanitization

### Infrastructure Security
- Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities
- Dependencies are automatically updated and scanned
- Security policies are enforced via pre-commit hooks
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please follow these steps:

### 1. DO NOT create a public GitHub issue

Instead, please use one of these secure channels:

### 2. Report via GitHub Security Advisories
- Go to the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/terragon-labs/llm-cost-tracker/security/advisories) page
- Click "Report a vulnerability"
- Fill out the form with detailed information

### 3. Report via Email (Alternative)
Send an email to: **security@terragonlabs.com**

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if known)
- Your contact information for follow-up

### 4. Encrypted Communication
For highly sensitive reports, you can use our PGP key:
```
-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
[PGP Key would be here in real implementation]
-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
```

## Response Timeline
