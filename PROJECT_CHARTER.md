# Project Charter: LLM Cost Tracker

## Project Overview

### Problem Statement
Organizations adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with unpredictable costs, lack of visibility into usage patterns, and absence of automated cost controls. Current solutions are either cloud-vendor-specific or require expensive third-party services, creating vendor lock-in and limited customization options.

### Solution Summary
LLM Cost Tracker is a self-hostable, open-source platform that provides real-time cost monitoring, automated budget controls, and intelligent model optimization for LLM deployments. Built on OpenTelemetry standards, it integrates seamlessly with existing observability infrastructure while offering advanced features like budget-aware model swapping.

## Project Scope

### In Scope
- **Cost Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of token usage, latency, and costs
- **Budget Management**: Automated alerts and model swapping based on configurable rules
- **Integration Layer**: LangChain, LiteLLM, and major LLM provider support
- **Observability**: Grafana dashboards, Prometheus metrics, and alerting
- **Self-Hosting**: Complete Docker-based deployment with minimal dependencies
- **Multi-tenancy**: Organization and project-level cost isolation (v0.3.0+)

### Out of Scope
- **Model Training**: We track inference costs only, not training costs
- **Model Development**: Not a model development or fine-tuning platform
- **Direct LLM Hosting**: We monitor external LLM services, not host models
- **General Observability**: Focused on LLM costs, not general application monitoring

## Success Criteria

### Primary Objectives
1. **Cost Reduction**: Enable 20-30% average cost savings through intelligent monitoring and optimization
2. **Deployment Simplicity**: Sub-5-minute setup time for new installations
3. **Observability Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Prometheus/Grafana stacks
4. **Community Adoption**: 1000+ active installations within 12 months of v1.0
